#MY Chess

A personal project to create an online chess app to extend the paid features of platforms like chess.com and lichess to friends and family. I wanted to take on the challenge of programming a game I know the rules of well without using any outside chess libraries to determine board state or valid moves.

Currently functioning as an offline chess game that runs in the browser using JavaScript and React for the logic and visuals.
